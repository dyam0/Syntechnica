# Syntechnica (server-side)

Syntechnica is an application that will provide a remote way to manage files, 
integrate third-party applications to remotely run scripts in their environment, 
and provide a convenient way to manage users and their capabilities within the system.

This is the repository of the Syntechnica server-side application. 
It will provide a RESTful (almost entirely) WEB API to interact with the application's domain.
