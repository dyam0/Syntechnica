[[overview]]
= Overview


[[overview_http_verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

Syntechnica tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PUT`
| Used to completely replace an existing resource

| `PATCH`
| Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===




[[overview_http_status_codes]]
== HTTP status codes

Syntechnica tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist

| `500 Internal Server Error`
| The server encountered an unexpected condition
that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
|===




[[overview_errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

include::{snippets}/error-permitted/response-fields.adoc[]

IMPORTANT: Internal server errors (status code 500) have no messages
so to not reveal internal details of the application state.


For example, a request that attempts to generate a token pair using
invalid credentials will produce a following response:

include::{snippets}/tokens-generate-credentials-error-invalid-credentials/http-response.adoc[]



[[overview_hypermedia]]
== Hypermedia

Syntechnica uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in their
responses. Resource responses are in https://github.com/mikekelly/hal_specification[Hypertext
Application Language (HAL)] format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key.

IMPORTANT: Users of the API *should not* create (hardcode) URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described
links to navigate from resource to resource.




[[resources]]
= Resources



[[resource_index]]
== Index

The index provides the entry point into the service.


[[resource_index_access]]
=== Accessing the index

A `GET` request is used to access the index

operation::index-access[snippets='http-request,http-response,response-fields,links']




[[resource_tokens]]
== Tokens

The Tokens resource is used to generate *refresh* and *access* token pairs for future authorized requests.


[[resource_tokens_info_access]]
=== Access tokens
The access token is used to authorize the request by adding it to the `Authorization` HTTP header
with the `Bearer` prefix: `Authorization: Bearer ENCODED_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

*Only the last received* access token should be used.
Otherwise, the access token and the refresh token of the current token pair
will be *invalidated* for security purposes.


[[resource_tokens_info_refresh]]
=== Refresh tokens
The refresh token is used to obtain new access token.

Each refresh token must be used *only once*,
then a newly received refresh token must be used to obtain new access token.
Otherwise, the access token and the refresh token of the current token pair
will be *invalidated* for security purposes.


[[resource_tokens_info_security]]
=== Token security
Suppose a legitimate user uses the last access token received and does not reuse Ð° refresh token,
but has been denied to use one of that tokens.
In that case, the tokens were probably also owned by the malicious user.
Don't worry, the tokens owned by the legitimate user and the malicious user are invalidated,
so the legitimate user just has to generate new tokens using his credentials.

IMPORTANT: Access tokens *should not* be stored in Local Storage.
Instead, store the access token in a
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures#emulating_private_methods_with_closures[JavaScript closure]
(emulating private method),
and store the refresh token in Local Storage.
Thanks to the fact that Syntechnica on the server side automatically determines the relevance of tokens,
this will be the most secure solution.


[[resource_tokens_generate]]
=== Generating tokens

The `POST` request is used to generate a token pair.


This is the only operation currently supported for Tokens resource.


[[resource_tokens_generate_credentials]]
==== Generating using credentials

operation::tokens-generate-credentials[snippets='request-fields,http-request,http-response,response-fields,links']


[[resource_tokens_generate_refresh_tokens]]
==== Generating using refresh token

operation::tokens-generate-refresh-token[snippets='request-fields,http-request,http-response,response-fields,links']
